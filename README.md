# Databaser inl√§mning 3

This is a sample project to use for one of the assignments in the course "Databaser" at
Yrgo. This is only intended as a very simple example.

With the script create_database.sql you can set up a MS SQL Server 2019 database
and connect to it using JDBC.

"mvn package" will build a fat jar containing everything that is needed
to run the program.
